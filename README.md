# Weight_Prediction App
- This is an end-to-end data science project that predicts weight in kilograms for a given height input in centimeters. The project includes a Simple Linear Regression model implemented using scikit-learn, and a web interface built with Flask. The model is deployed on Heroku, and the application provides both a web-based interface and an API for making predictions.
